# 🎓 Design and Analysis of Algorithms - Learning Portfolio

Welcome to my **Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA) Learning Portfolio**! 🚀  
This is more than just a collection of notes—it’s my **hands-on journey** through algorithms, data structures, real-world applications, and problem-solving strategies learned at **KLE Technological University**.

## ✨ Why This Portfolio is Special

This isn’t your average boring report. I built this portfolio to **showcase learning in style**:

- **Glassmorphism Magic**: Sleek frosted-glass sections make the UI look like something from the future. 🪟  
- **Dynamic Animated Header**: A gradient animation keeps things alive and vibrant. 🌈  
- **Interactive Accordion Sections**: Expand and collapse content smoothly—because scrolling forever is overrated. 🎢  
- **Fully Responsive Design**: Looks perfect on any device, whether it’s your laptop or your phone. 📱💻  
- **DAA Content Galore**: From Arrays to Trees, Sorting to Dynamic Programming, and even a real-world course project.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack I Used

I built this entire portfolio **from scratch** using:

- **HTML5**: For semantic, structured content.  
- **CSS3**:
  - Custom properties for easy theme adjustments.  
  - Flexbox to organize the layout like a pro.  
  - Keyframe animations to bring the page alive.  
  - `backdrop-filter` for that frosted-glass, futuristic look.  
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: Powered the accordion sections and added interactivity without relying on heavy frameworks. ⚡
