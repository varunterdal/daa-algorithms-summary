# 🏙️ Smart City with Algorithms 🚦🤖  

Hey there! 👋 Welcome to my **Smart City project**, built as part of my **Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA)** course.  

This repo is not just code – it’s my **learning journey + creativity + fun** all rolled into one 🎉  

---

## ✨ The Story Behind It  
When I started DAA, I thought it was all about **boring math & big O notations** 🙈.  
But then… 💡 I realized algorithms are literally **everywhere** – from traffic signals 🚦 to online shopping carts 🛒.  

So, I decided to **design a Smart City using algorithms** – making the theory come alive in a real-world setting.  
And guess what? It was actually **fun** 🕺🔥

## 🛠️ How I Built This  
1. **HTML** → built the structure like the skeleton of the city 🏗️  
2. **CSS** → added styles (because a city without lights looks dull 💡🌃)  
3. **JavaScript** → gave it life, toggling sections like traffic lights switching green/red 🚦  
4. **DAA Concepts** → this was the secret sauce 🍝 – I applied algorithms for:  
   - Shortest paths (Dijkstra’s) → 🚑 Ambulances finding fastest routes  
   - Optimization (Knapsack) → 📦 Managing limited resources  
   - Graphs → 🛣️ Road networks and city planning  
   - Divide & Conquer → 📊 Breaking problems into manageable pieces

## 🚀 Why It Was Fun  
- I wasn’t just writing dry theory – I was **building my own city** (a mini SimCity but with algorithms 😍)  
- Watching algorithms solve real-world problems felt like **magic ✨**  
- The portfolio website turned into my **digital playground** where I could show my work proudly 🖥️🎨  
- And… deploying it on **GitHub Pages** meant anyone can visit my city 🌍
